	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures how an algorithm's efficiency scales with the size of its input. It provides an asymptotic upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's runtime, typically expressed using Big-O notation (e.g., O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n²)). An efficient algorithm often strives for logarithmic (O(log n)) or linear time, whereas exponential complexities (O(2ⁿ)) are generally infeasible for large inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another fundamental concept that measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to its input size (n). It determines how much additional storage (beyond the input itself) is needed during execution. Like time complexity, it is expressed using Big-O notation (e.g., O(1), O(n), O(n²)). An algorithm with O(1) uses a fixed amount of memory, regardless of input size. In contrast, O(n) means memory usage grows linearly with input size. Higher complexities like O(n²) occur when algorithms generate 2D structures (e.g., matrices).</p>
