	 <h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time and space complexity are fundamental concepts in computer science that measure how an algorithm's efficient scales with the size of its input. They are used to evaluate how much time and memory an algorithm needs to run.</p>
    <p>Space complexity is a measure of how much additional memory an algorithm needs to use relative to the size of its input. It helps us understand how the memory requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases.O(n) means the algorithm's memory usage grows linearly with the input size n.
    If the input size doubles, the required memory also (approximately) doubles.
    It indicates that the algorithm uses additional space proportional to the input size.</p>
    <b>Auxiliary Space: The extra space used by the algorithm beyond the input data
     Input Space: The space required to store the input itself Total Space Complexity: Typically refers to auxiliary space (unless specified otherwise)</b>
