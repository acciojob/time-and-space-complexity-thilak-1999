	 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time and space complexity are fundamental concepts in computer science that measure how an algorithm's efficient scales with the size of its input. Time complexity is efficient to use the code run timing and this helps to the reduce of the line of code in the programming.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to its input size (n). It determines how much additional storage (beyond the input itself) is needed during execution. Like time complexity, it is expressed using Big-O notation (e.g., O(1), O(n), O(nÂ²)).  
    An algorithm with O(1)  uses a fixed amount of memory, regardless of input size. For example, a loop summing numbers requires only one variable for storage. In contrast, O(n)  means memory usage grows linearly with input size, such as storing an array or a recursive call stack with n depth.
